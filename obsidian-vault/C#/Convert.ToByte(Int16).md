### [[Input Methods#Multiplication program|Multiplication program]]
You have some data you need to go from a string to an int. You do this by assigning a variable to the result of the action ``Convert.ToInt16(X);`` with the X being the thing you want to convert.

The code inside of ``Program.cs`` looks like this:
```cs
int number = Convert.ToInt16(input);
```

This takes the string ``input`` and converts it to an int called ``number``.
