# Abstract
## Uses
When a [[client program]] needs a function done, it might be better to remove that function from the client program into its own ==class==. This offers up some advantages over having it be inside of the client program sometimes.

### Small use
Say that your client program want to know what a number X is after its been multiplied by number Y. It could have that functionality exist and work within itself, or another class could be made where the functionality is called from another place. This call could contain some info, such as the number that it wants to be multiplied and it would get back the result.
