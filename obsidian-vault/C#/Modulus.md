![[Modulus Visual.png|150]]
You have 9 and wish to divide it by 4. You can do so 2 full times, but that leaves one absent. The modulus shows that absentee. Where ``9 / 4 = 2``, the modulus 
``9 % 4 = 1`` instead. Take 9 divided by 10 instead; 9 fits into 10 zero times, so 
``9 / 10 = 0`` but ``9 % 10 = 9`` as this is whats left over.
